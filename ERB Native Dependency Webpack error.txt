 Webpack does not work with native dependencies.
electron-edge-js is a native dependency and should be installed inside of the "./release/app" folder.
 First, uninstall the packages from "./package.json":
npm uninstall your-package
 Then, instead of installing the package to the root "./package.json":
npm install your-package
 Install the package to "./release/app/package.json"
cd ./release/app && npm install your-package
